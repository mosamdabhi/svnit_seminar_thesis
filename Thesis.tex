		In this work, we study the problem of planning
		safe and dynamically feasible trajectories through a densely cluttered environment. We devise an experimental approach to the design of
		smooth trajectories for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles
		(UAVs), which are free of collisions with obstacles along their
		entire length. To avoid the non-convex constraints normally
		required for obstacle-avoidance, we perform a mixed-integer
		optimization in which polynomial trajectories are assigned to
		convex regions which are known to be obstacle-free. Prior
		approaches have used the faces of the obstacles themselves to
		define these convex regions. The innovative approach brought about here is the use of Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite Programming(IRIS)
		algorithm, a recently developed technique for greedy convex segmentation~\cite{deits2015computing}, to pre-compute convex regions of safe space. The aforementioned approach results in a substantially reduced number of integer variables, which improves the speed with which the optimization can be solved to its global optimum, even for tens or hundreds of obstacle faces. In addition, prior approaches have typically enforced obstacle avoidance at a finite set of sample or knot points. This study supports a technique based on sums-of-squares (SOS) programming that allows the user to ensure that the entire piecewise polynomial trajectory is free of collisions using convex constraints. To support this study, we demonstrate this technique in 2D and in 3D random environments and also in a cluttered indoor environment given by a dense pointcloud.
